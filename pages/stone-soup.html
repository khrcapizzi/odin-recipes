        <div>
            <p class="description">Stone soup is my version of zuppa Toscana, a classic Italian dish. I learned this recipe from my mother and in my early twenties I came to depend on it as a cheap, comforting dish I could make with as few or as many ingredients as I had available. I came to call it stone soup because once the base of the soup is prepared, almost anything can be added to create a satisfying meal.</p>
